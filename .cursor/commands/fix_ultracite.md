# Ultracite Code Quality and Formatting Fix Workflow

## Objective

Fix all Ultracite linting and formatting issues in the frontend codebase systematically and recursively until the code achieves zero linting violations and follows all accessibility, type safety, and code quality standards.

## Project Context

- **Frontend Location**: `app/frontend/` (TypeScript/React components and services)
- **Linting Tool**: Ultracite (Biome's strict mode) - configured in `biome.json`
- **Key Standards Enforced**:
  - Strict type safety (no `any`, proper generics)
  - Accessibility compliance (a11y standards, semantic HTML)
  - Code complexity and quality (clean, maintainable code)
  - React/JSX best practices
  - Correctness and safety
  - Consistent code style and formatting
- **Package Manager**: bun (monorepo workspace)
- **Design Principles**: Uncle Bob (Clean Code), Martin Fowler (Refactoring), Eric Evans (Domain-Driven Design)

## Pre-Execution Checklist

Before starting the workflow:

1. Verify you understand the Ultracite rules and standards in the workspace context
2. Review the accessibility requirements - these are non-negotiable
3. Understand that `--unsafe=true` flag enables automatic fixes for complex issues
4. Familiarize yourself with common issues: unused imports, accessibility violations, type safety
5. Check existing patterns in similar files before making manual changes
6. Remember: automatic fixes should be reviewed, not blindly accepted
7. **Understand architectural refactoring priorities**: Complexity and magic number violations should be refactored according to project architecture (domain-driven design, clean code) rather than quick fixes
8. **CRITICAL: Never use biome ignore comments when a fix is possible**: Suppressing violations with `// biome-ignore` comments is strictly forbidden when a proper fix exists. Always fix the root cause rather than hiding the problem.

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Issue Discovery

**Parameter Check**:

- **If a specific folder/file path is supplied**: Run all ultracite checks scoped to that path
- **If NO folder/file is supplied**: Default to scanning the entire `app/frontend/` directory
- Store this path for consistent use throughout all subsequent ultracite runs

Command method (use bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true as primary tool):

- With folder supplied: `bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true [supplied-folder]`
- Without folder supplied: `bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true app/frontend/`

To check violations before fixing:

- With folder supplied: `bun ultracite check [supplied-folder]`
- Without folder supplied: `bun ultracite check app/frontend/`

Steps:

1. Determine the scope (use supplied path or default to `app/frontend/`)
2. Run `bun ultracite check [scope]` to identify violations WITHOUT making changes
3. Capture ALL error/warning output completely
   - **Note**: If the output is very large (e.g., 500+ violations), it's acceptable to read it in multiple steps as it may not fit in the context window
   - You may need to process the output incrementally to capture all violations
4. Count total violations and categorize by type (unused imports, accessibility, type safety, formatting, etc.)
5. **Create violation documentation files**: Write all violations to markdown files in `docs/biome/` directory
   - **If violations ≤ 100**: Create a single file `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-001.md`
   - **If violations > 100**: Split into multiple files with 100 violations per file
     - File naming: `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-001.md`, `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-002.md`, etc.
     - Each file contains exactly 100 violations (except the last file which may have fewer)
     - Numbering continues across files (001.md has violations 1-100, 002.md has violations 101-200, etc.)
   - Each bullet point should contain: file path, line number, rule name, and violation message
   - Format: `1. [filepath:line] [rule] violation message`
   - Example: `1. [app/frontend/components/Button.tsx:42] [a11y/useKeyWithClickEvents] Missing keyboard event handler`
   - Include nothing else in these files - only the numbered violation list
6. Do NOT attempt fixes yet - only gather information and document
7. **🚫 CRITICAL: After creating violation documentation files in `docs/biome/`, DO NOT run `bun ultracite check` again until Phase 4**
   - The markdown files become the single source of truth for all violations
   - All fixes in Phase 3 must be based on the violations documented in the `docs/biome/` files
   - Re-running the check command will only happen in Phase 4 after all documented violations are addressed
   - This prevents redundant command executions and ensures fixes are based on the documented violation list

### Phase 2: Create Structured Todo List

1. **Read the violation documentation files** in `docs/biome/` created in Phase 1 to understand all violations
   - Read all files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md` to get the complete violation list
   - Process files sequentially if there are multiple files
2. **Use the Cursor built-in todo list** (NOT an .md file)
3. Create todos using the `todo_write` tool with these guidelines:
   - **One todo per violation category** initially (e.g., "Fix accessibility violations in components", "Remove unused imports in services")
   - **Break down large categories** into specific file-based todos if the category has 5+ violations
   - **Prioritize by impact**: Fix accessibility (a11y) first, then type safety, then code quality
   - **Include file paths and violation types** in todo titles for clarity
   - Set initial status: `pending` for all
4. Order todos strategically:
   - First: Accessibility violations (`app/frontend/features/`, `app/frontend/shared/ui/`)
   - Second: Type safety issues (`app/frontend/entities/`, `app/frontend/services/`)
   - Third: Unused imports and exports (`app/frontend/`)
   - Fourth: Code complexity and formatting (`app/frontend/`)
   - Fifth: React/JSX best practices (`app/frontend/`)

### Phase 3: Iterative Issue Resolution

#### IMPORTANT: Maintain scope consistency throughout

- Use the SAME folder/file path (supplied or default `app/frontend/`) for all ultracite runs
- All fixes should be made only within the defined scope
- Do not fix issues outside the supplied scope, even if discovered

**For each todo in order:**

1. **Read the Violation Details**

   - Reference the files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md` for the complete violation list
   - Identify specific files, line numbers, and violation messages
   - Verify violations are within the defined scope
   - Understand the rule being violated and why
   - Categorize: automatic fix candidate vs. requires manual intervention
   - Check if violation is in a dependency or the main code

2. **Analyze Before Fixing**

   - For accessibility issues: Ensure semantic alternatives exist before changing
   - For unused imports: Verify they're not exported as part of public API
   - For type safety: Check if violations align with the project's strictness goals
   - **For complexity violations**: Refactor according to project architecture (extract to domain entities, services, or utilities) rather than superficial fixes
   - **For magic numbers**: Extract to named constants in appropriate domain entities or configuration modules per project architecture
   - Review similar patterns in the codebase to maintain consistency

3. **Categorize Fixes**

   - **Automatic (via `bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true`)**: Formatting, unused imports, simple removals
   - **Manual**: Accessibility (requires domain knowledge), component logic changes
   - **Architectural Refactoring** (preferred for complexity/magic numbers): Refactor to align with project architecture (domain-driven design, clean code principles) rather than quick fixes
   - **Hybrid**: Some violations need both automatic fixes and manual review
   - **🚫 NEVER**: Use `// biome-ignore` or `/* biome-ignore */` comments to suppress violations when a fix is possible. Suppressions are only acceptable in extremely rare cases where fixing would break legitimate functionality AND no alternative solution exists. Always attempt a proper fix first.

4. **Apply Fixes (Work from Documentation)**

   - For manual fixes: Correct the issues directly based on the files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md`
   - For automatic fixes: Use `bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true [scope]` to apply fixes
   - **Fix ALL violations in the current todo batch** based on the files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md`
   - Ensure changes maintain code quality and project standards

5. **Verify the Fix (Work from Documentation)**

   - **🚫 DO NOT run `bun ultracite check` here** - work from the files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md` instead
   - Mark violations as resolved in your todos based on the fixes you've applied
   - Update the todo status to `in_progress`, then `completed` when you've fixed all violations in that batch
   - The final verification will happen in Phase 4, not during Phase 3

6. **Document Learnings**
   - If a fix reveals a pattern or reusable solution, note it internally
   - If similar violations appear elsewhere, apply the same fix proactively before running the next check
   - Note accessibility patterns for future components

### Phase 4: Recursive Validation Loop

**After completing all todos:**

1. **🚨 FIRST TIME RUNNING COMMAND SINCE PHASE 1**: Now run `bun ultracite check [scope]` (supplied path or `app/frontend/`) to verify all documented violations are fixed
2. **If violations remain**:
   - Update the files in `docs/biome/` with the remaining violations (replace file contents with the new violation list, splitting into 100 per file as needed)
   - Run `bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true [scope]` to fix remaining violations
   - Create new todos for any remaining violations that require manual intervention (within scope)
   - Repeat Phase 3 until all violations are gone (working from the updated files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md`)
   - This may involve cascading fixes (fixing one issue reveals another)
   - **🚫 DO NOT run the check command again** until you've fixed all violations in the updated files in `docs/biome/`
3. **If zero violations**:
   - Success! All Ultracite violations are resolved within the defined scope.
   - Optionally delete files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md` (or keep them for reference)
   - Run `bun ultracite check [scope]` to confirm no violations remain
   - Apply final formatting via `bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true [scope]` if needed
   - Verify with `bun tsgo --noEmit` from `app/frontend/` to ensure no TypeScript issues were introduced

## Critical Optimization Principle

**Run `bun ultracite check` ONLY in Phase 1 and Phase 4:**

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Run once to discover all violations and create files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md`
- ❌ **Phase 3**: DO NOT run - work from files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md` instead
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Run only after completing all todos to verify fixes
- ✅ Use `bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true [scope]` as the primary tool for applying fixes during Phase 3
- ❌ Do NOT re-run after every single fix
- ❌ Do NOT re-run between related changes
- ❌ Do NOT run on different scopes than defined at the start
- ✅ Always use the SAME scope throughout the entire workflow
- ✅ Minimize total check runs to save time and resources

This approach ensures efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The files in `docs/biome/ultracite-violations-*.md` are the single source of truth during Phase 3, eliminating the need for repeated check command executions. Keep scope consistent across all executions.

## Best Practices During Execution

### Accessibility (Critical Priority)

- ✅ Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- ✅ Validate that `aria-hidden="true"` is NEVER on focusable elements
- ✅ Check that form labels are associated with inputs
- ✅ Ensure images have meaningful alt text
- ✅ Use semantic HTML elements instead of role attributes
- ❌ Don't add `accessKey` attributes
- ❌ Don't use distracting elements like `<marquee>`

### Type Safety

- ❌ Never use `any` - use `unknown` with type narrowing or proper generics
- ❌ Never use non-null assertions (`!`) - fix the underlying type issue
- ✅ Use `import type` for type-only imports
- ✅ Use `as const` for literal types
- ✅ Use generics for reusable, type-safe functions

### Code Quality

- **🚫 CRITICAL: Never use biome ignore comments when a fix is possible**: Using `// biome-ignore` or `/* biome-ignore */` to suppress violations is strictly forbidden when a proper fix exists. Always fix the root cause rather than hiding the problem. Suppressions should only be considered in extremely rare edge cases where fixing would genuinely break legitimate functionality AND no alternative solution exists. In 99% of cases, a proper fix is possible and required.
- Prefer removing unused code over leaving it with suppressions
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Maintain existing code style and patterns
- Fix only what's necessary; don't refactor unrelated code
- **For complexity violations**: Refactor according to project architecture principles (Domain-Driven Design, Clean Code) - extract complex logic to domain entities (`app/frontend/entities/`), services, or utility modules rather than applying superficial fixes
- **For magic numbers**: Extract to named constants in appropriate domain entities or configuration modules (`app/frontend/shared/config/`, domain entities) following architectural patterns - do NOT just assign to local variables

### React/JSX Rules

- ✅ Always include `key` props in iterators and lists (use stable identifiers, NOT array indices)
- ✅ Make sure React hooks dependencies are complete
- ✅ Use semantic HTML elements instead of role attributes
- ❌ Don't use dangerous JSX props without justification
- ❌ Don't use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without strong reason

### Import/Export Patterns

- ✅ Use `import type` for type-only imports
- ✅ Centralize type definitions in domain entities (`app/frontend/entities/`)
- ✅ Use barrel exports (index.ts) for logical modules
- ❌ Don't export unused variables
- ❌ Don't leave unused imports

| Incorrect ARIA usage      | Use semantic HTML or correct ARIA attributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Formatting issues         | Use `bun ultracite fix --unsafe=true [scope]` to apply formatting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Incorrect key in lists    | Replace array index with stable identifier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Dangling refs             | Ensure all forward refs and refs are properly handled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Component naming          | Ensure components are PascalCase, functions are camelCase                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Complexity violations** | **Refactor according to project architecture** - extract complex logic to domain entities (`app/frontend/entities/`), services, or utility modules. Follow DDD and Clean Code principles rather than superficial simplification                                                                       |
| **Magic numbers**         | **Extract to named constants in appropriate domain entities or configuration modules** (`app/frontend/shared/config/`, domain entities) per architectural patterns. Do NOT just assign to local variables - ensure proper placement in the architecture                                               |
| **Any violation**         | **🚫 NEVER use `// biome-ignore` when a fix is possible** - Always fix the root cause. Suppressions are forbidden except in extremely rare edge cases where fixing would break legitimate functionality AND no alternative exists. In practice, proper fixes are almost always possible and required. |
