## Code Refactoring Command (FSCA + DDD + Clean Architecture)

### Objective

PLANNING PHASE ONLY — Generate a comprehensive refactoring plan aligned with Feature-Sliced Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design, and Clean Architecture principles, **adapting to the specific user goals**. Execution happens ONLY after explicit user approval.

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:**

- **Flexible objectives**: Refactoring goals may vary (code splitting, behavioral changes, performance optimization, testing improvements, DI enhancement, technical debt reduction, etc.) — understand the user's actual objective first
- **Preserve unless explicitly changing**: When behavioral changes are required, implement them as specified; when not specified, maintain identical behavior
- **Move as-is when possible**: Extract code blocks verbatim when they fit architecture without modification
- **Architectural adaptations allowed**: When architecture patterns require structural changes (wrappers, adapters, interface implementations, call signature changes), make ONLY those changes — preserve all business logic inside
- **Strict structure adherence**: All code must be placed in correct layers per `@nextjs_structure.mdc`, adapting structure as needed while keeping functionality identical
- **NO deprecation, removal, or legacy wrappers**: Do NOT deprecate code, do NOT remove code, do NOT create legacy wrappers, and do NOT maintain backward compatibility. Refactor code directly to the new structure — update all usages immediately

### Architecture Source of Truth

- All architecture details (FSD layers, DDD patterns, Clean Architecture mapping, dependency rules, public API rules, file size limits, testing structure, error handling) are defined in `@nextjs_structure.mdc` (located at `.cursor/rules/nextjs_structure.mdc`).
- Do not restate architecture in this prompt. Always reference and follow `@nextjs_structure.mdc`.

## Refactoring Workflow

### Phase 0: Understand User Objectives (PLANNING ONLY)

**Before starting analysis, clarify the refactoring goal:**

- What is the primary objective? (e.g., code splitting, behavioral change, performance optimization, testing, DI improvement, tech debt reduction, etc.)
- Are there specific pain points or code smells to address?
- Should behavior be preserved or intentionally changed? (and what changes if applicable)
- Are there specific metrics or success criteria?
- Are there constraints (e.g., specific architecture patterns)?

This context shapes the entire refactoring plan and determines what "success" looks like.

### Phase 1: Analysis (PLANNING ONLY)

1. **Read target file**

   - Identify components, hooks, business logic, types, utilities
   - Map dependencies and imports
   - Note code smells: large files, mixed concerns, SRP violations, performance bottlenecks, testing difficulties, etc.
   - **Preserve all logic (unless change is explicit)**: Document what each section does to ensure identical behavior after refactoring (unless user explicitly requested behavioral changes)

2. **Identify refactoring opportunities aligned with user goals**

   - Map code to layers/patterns defined in `@nextjs_structure.mdc`
   - Plan extractions to entities/features/widgets/pages/shared as appropriate
   - Plan DTOs, repositories, adapters, mappers, factories, and value objects as needed
   - **Tailor to objective**: If goal is code splitting → prioritize extraction and modularization; if goal is performance → prioritize caching, memoization, optimization; if goal is testing → prioritize testability and DI; if goal is behavioral change → prioritize implementation of new requirements
   - **Move vs adapt**: Determine if code can be moved as-is or needs architectural wrapping/adaptation (e.g., wrap existing function in repository interface, create adapter for external API call)
   - **Preserve logic (unless specified)**: Even when adapting structure, keep all business logic, calculations, conditionals, and error handling exactly as-is (unless user explicitly requested changes)

3. **Check import boundaries**
   - Enforce inward dependency flow per `@nextjs_structure.mdc`
   - No cross-feature imports or upward dependencies
   - Use public API `index.ts` exports only (no deep imports)
   - **Functionality unchanged**: Changing import paths does not change what the code does

### Phase 2: Generate Refactoring Plan

**Output**: Create markdown file at `/docs/[filename]-refactor.md`

**Structure**:

```markdown
# Refactoring Plan: [Filename]

## User Objectives

- **Primary Goal**: [e.g., code splitting, performance optimization, behavioral enhancement, testing improvement, DI enhancement, tech debt reduction]
- **Specific Requirements**: [list any specific changes, constraints, or success criteria]
- **Behavioral Changes**: [if any, describe what should change; if none, state "Preserve all existing behavior"]

## Current State

- File: `[path]`
- Size: [X] lines
- Issues: [list code smells relevant to the goal]
- Current behavior: [summarize how it works now]

## Proposed Changes

**Refactoring Approach:**

- **Goal-aligned strategy**: [Describe how the plan addresses the user's primary objective]
- **Scope**: [What will change, what won't]
- **Behavioral impact**: [How existing behavior is preserved or intentionally changed]

**Refactoring Constraints:**

- **Move as-is when possible**: Extract exact code blocks verbatim when they fit architecture structure
- **Architectural adaptations allowed**: When architecture requires structural changes, wrap/adapt code while preserving all business logic:
  - Create repository interfaces and implement them with existing logic
  - Wrap functions in adapters to match architectural patterns
  - Change call signatures to match interfaces (but keep implementation identical)
  - Split code across layers as required by `@nextjs_structure.mdc`
- **Logic preservation or intentional changes**: [If goal requires behavior changes, implement them; otherwise preserve all conditionals, calculations, data transformations, error handling, and business rules exactly]
- **Update imports**: Change import paths to use public APIs and maintain correct dependency flow

| ---- | ---------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1    | Extract domain types         | 10-50        | `entities/{entity}/types/`          | None                 | Move as-is                     |
| 2    | Extract value objects        | 51-100       | `entities/{entity}/value-objects/`  | types                | Move as-is                     |
| 3    | Extract domain entity        | 101-200      | `entities/{entity}/core/`           | types, value-objects | Move as-is or adapt to pattern |

| 9    | Extract UI components        | 481-600      | `features/{feature}/ui/`            | hooks                | Move as-is                     |
| 10   | Update public APIs           | -            | Various `index.ts` files            | All above            | Export only                    |

## Expected Outcomes

- **Goal metrics**: [Specific metrics related to the user's objective, e.g., "Files created: X", "Performance improvement: Y%", "Test coverage increase: Z%", "Complexity reduction", etc.]
- **Code organization**: [Files created/modified, original file size impact if applicable]
- **Architectural compliance**: [How it adheres to `@nextjs_structure.mdc`]
- **Behavioral validation**: [How to verify the objective was achieved]

## Verification Steps

- [ ] TypeScript compiles
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Objective achieved: [specific verification related to user goal]
- [ ] Import boundaries respected (see `@nextjs_structure.mdc`)
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Behavioral changes (if any) match user requirements
```

### Phase 3: Execution (ONLY AFTER USER APPROVAL)

#### Wait for User Approval

Do not proceed until user explicitly says "execute the plan"

1. **Create todo list**

   - One todo per plan step
   - Set all to `pending`

2. **Execute each step**

   - Create target file
   - **Move or adapt as needed**:
     - If code fits architecture: Move verbatim — copy code blocks exactly as-is
     - If architecture requires adaptation: Wrap/adapt structure (interfaces, adapters, signatures) while preserving all business logic inside
   - **Preserve all logic**: Never modify conditionals, calculations, data transformations, error handling, or business rules — only structural/wrapper changes
   - **Update all usages immediately**: Update all imports and references to point to the new locations. Do NOT leave old code in place, do NOT create legacy wrappers, do NOT deprecate anything
   - Update imports to use public APIs (change import paths, maintain dependency flow)
   - **Verify behavior preserved**: Ensure refactored code performs identically to original — same inputs produce same outputs
   - Verify immediately: `bun tsc --noEmit`, `bunx biome check .`
   - Mark todo complete

3. **Final validation**
   - Run all linters and type checks
   - Run tests
   - Verify import boundaries and no circular dependencies
